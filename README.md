cjsr_schedule_crud
==================

A Backbone project for managing content on CJSR's Online Program Schedule.

This project is being managed with Yeoman, Bower and Grunt. You may need to use Bower to install the proper dependencies.

Javascript files are managed with RequireJS as modules.


Todo list:

  - Switch to using Marionette with Backbone for cleaner code, etc.
  - Create a mobile-first responsive design using Twitter Bootstrap.
